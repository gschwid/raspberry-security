# raspberry-security

Working on creating a security system on a raspberry pi for my room. The system will use pytorch for a binary clasification system, I will be recognized t hrough facial recognition. I want to create some sort of website/email interface that senmds me a notification each time someone that is not recognized as me enters the room.
